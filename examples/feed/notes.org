#+TITLE: Notes

- What if, in one.fk, the e.g. client is busy doing something else?


- Problem; in two.fk so far the e.g. server has to basically just idle waiting
  for the newData message to be received.

  Need to set it up so that the offering of newData gets triggered by a request
  and isn't just permeanantly there

- In three, when a thread 'idles' we inform it with with what kind of operation
  to perform when it restarts.

  This is pretty inconvenient as it means that for any new thing it wants to do,
  we have to add a new item in the "action" datatype, etc

- so three basically is just blocking; the server has to give the new data at
  the same time as the client requests. this means the client can't continue to
  display new information


- four.fk idea; when the server responds, take the data and store it in
  refState, then give it to the server later
